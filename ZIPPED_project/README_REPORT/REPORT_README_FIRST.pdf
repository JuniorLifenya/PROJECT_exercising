The following way to read / do the exercise and files handed. 

1) MAIN_CPP_CODES folder. Look at the Hamiltonian_FDM_Build, then , Main , then plot_wave, then E_vs_eigenvalues
2) PHASE_SPACE_stuff. Look at wigner_calc_Ground_State_distribution, then my_wigner, then wigner 3D_wigner.cpp, then 3D(python version if you want), ignore plot_wave momentum_density.C
3) Look at MAIN_CPP_CODES folder / RUNGE-Kutta files. I failed to use them, becuase it became complicated for hamiltonian stuff. But i have included examples for their use and outputs 



So everything is kind of working trough the Main.cpp where it runs and solves for the eigenvalues and vectors( also wave functions).
Then it saves wavefunction and energies as .dat files so we can visuallly read the values there

Plots are generated inside the OUTPUT folder where we have the eigenvalues saved as a root file that can be used. I think also that the eigenvalues
in the output files can be used for this plotting but idk how (maybe overthinking ) i mean i already know the values so it should be doable. 

It was hard to ACTUALLY use the runge kutta codes i made (it was fun though ). I tried manny different approaches like computing
the TDSE and kind of plot each wave function probability density for different times like snapshot. But that failed badly 

Lastly the PHASE_SPACE folder is also super important. Here we actually do the wigner distribution function and use it for plotting 
But i tried also to make a 3D version of this, so essentially you can integrate over the wigner function and get out a desired prbability density function 
depending on which variable you are integrating with respect to ( x, or p).

I failed to automate stuff i think. But there is still some code that kind of run smoothly as long as you know the 
compile and run commands. These are all stored in the Executable_compiled_Binaries. 
Other codes are stuff that i have tried and failed, etcc. 

I must say that i dont remember and under stand 100% of all my codes but a good amount of them, also it was superfun to read and learn about cpp and its usage 
I just did it my way which i hope is okey because this is always how i learn stuff in my life. More fun constructing, failing and trying again for countless hours alone. 
Since this was so fun i will mostly use my summer to try to really master c++ also, as far as i get.
